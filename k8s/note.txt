** What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container management tool.
It’s container management responsibilities include container deployment, scaling & descaling of containers & container load balancing.

** Features of kubernetes

Horizontal Scaling
Kubernetes needs only 1 command to scale up the containers

Service Discovery & Load balancing
automatically assign IP addresses to containers and a single DNS name for a set of containers
Can load-balance traffic inside the cluster. 

Self-Healing
Kubernetes can automatically restart containers that fail during execution 
Kills those containers that don’t respond to user-defined health checks
if nodes itself die, then it replaces and reschedules those failed containers on other available nodes.

Automatic Rollbacks & Rollouts
Rolls out changes and updates to your application by ensuring that not all instances are worked at the same instance
If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you.

** Kubernetes Architecture
Master nodes
Worker/Slave nodes

Master Node
It is the entry point for all administrative tasks which is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster

Worker/Slave nodes
It is a physical server or you can say a VM which runs the applications using Pods which is controlled by the master node

Pods
A pod is one or more containers that logically go together. Pods run on nodes

Services
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods
